# Spindle_project_Oct_2018
MATLAB, Data analysis, Physical Modelling 
--This records the state of projects Oct 2018 onwards. Main change from previous 
versions has been the modelling of torque from cortex, which is set such that 
the motor density on cortex results from a uniform angular disk of MTs around 
centrosomes. 

--Some new codes in this project will include codes for offset spindle.
